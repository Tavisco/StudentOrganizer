This software for Palm OS is intended to help students of all levels that have class schedules and homeworks to better keep track of those.

The main form tells you right away which is the current class, which will be the next, alongside an indicator that tells you if you have homework due tomorrow.

The classes management supports classes that occur multiple days of the week.

## Some background
As the Github description says, this is a recreation in C of a very similar application I've developed using [HB++](http://web.archive.org/web/20090622021514/http://www.handheld-basic.com/) when I was about 13 years old. I got the motivation to re-do it in C just to provoke myself with a new challenge, as I'm professionally NOT a C programmer, and to give back some love to the Palm platform, as programming that application in particular back then was a pretty significant step in settling down on choosing "what I will do when I grow up" :)


That being said, this is my first contact with the C language and with the Palm toolchain. Mistakes were probably made, so proceed with caution, and as always, use it at your own risk, I do not guarantee that this software will work as intended.

If you found an issue, please open one here in this repository that I may (or may not) fix it.
